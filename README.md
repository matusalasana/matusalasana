**`Frontend Developer (Developer/Designer)`**

Hi! I'm Sana â€” a civil engineering student turned passionate web developer with a laser focus on building clean, responsive, and high-performance web applications.

With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, I'm actively expanding my skills into the full-stack world using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I specialize in crafting intuitive user interfaces and bringing them to life with dynamic functionality and seamless backend integration.
